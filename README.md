# Daleri Mega, v1.2

## Template
The template was designed by [Andreas Viklund](http://andreasviklund.com/).

    Daleri Mega is a free, high-quality, standards-compliant XHTML/CSS
    template by Swedish template designer Andreas Viklund. It can be
    downloaded and used by anyone, and there are no limitations or obligations
    to worry about.

    If you want to support the template designer and encourage the development
    of more free templates, you should leave the footer credit link that says
    "Template design by Andreas Viklund". But if you need to remove the
    credits, you are free to do so. There are plenty of other ways to support
    the designers work if you want to.
